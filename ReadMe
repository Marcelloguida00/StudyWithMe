🍅 Study Timer & Goals App
A native iOS application developed in SwiftUI to manage study sessions, track goals, and monitor progress using the Pomodoro technique.

✨ Key Features
The app is organized into four main sections accessible via the TabBar:

1. ⏱️ Timer (Pomodoro)
The core of the application for time management.

Visual Interface: Features a custom CircularProgressView with gradients and smooth animations.

Pomodoro Logic: Handles the rotation between focus sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.

Severe Mode: A configurable setting that cancels the current session and timer if the user exits the app while the timer is running.

2. 🎯 Goals
A system to set and track specific study targets.

Target Setting: Users can define a goal (e.g., "Study Math") and assign a target number of "Pomodoros" required to complete it.

Tracking: Visual progress indicators for every active goal.

Editing: Includes the ability to update the title and Pomodoro target of existing goals via a modal sheet.

Persistence: Goals and their completion status are saved locally using UserDefaults.

3. 📖 History
A historical log of all completed study sessions.

Session Details: Displays the activity description, duration (in minutes), and date for every recorded session.

Data Management: Users can tap to edit session details (description, timestamp, or duration) or swipe to delete old entries.

Empty State: A user-friendly interface appears when no sessions have been recorded yet.

4. ⚙️ Settings
A configuration panel to customize the user experience.

Custom Durations: Configurable timers for Pomodoro, Short Break, and Long Break durations using Steppers.

Cycle Management: Adjustable setting for how many Pomodoros must be completed before triggering a Long Break.

Mode Toggles: Option to enable or disable "Severe Mode".

🛠️ Architecture & Tech Stack
The project is built strictly following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to separate business logic from the UI.

Language: Swift 5+

UI Framework: SwiftUI (utilizing NavigationStack and TabView).

Reactive Framework: Combine (extensive use of @Published properties and ObservableObject).

Data Persistence: UserDefaults with JSON encoding/decoding (Codable) to store sessions, goals, and user preferences.

Accessibility: Integrated support for accessibilityLabel and Reduce Motion handling in animations.

Project Structure
Views: Contains the User Interface (ContentView, HistoryView, GoalsView, SettingsView, CircularProgressView, EditGoalView).

ViewModels (Stores): Manage state and logic (SessionStore, GoalsStore, SettingsStore).

Models: Simple data structures (StudySession, Goal).

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository.

Open the .xcodeproj file with Xcode 15+.

Ensure the deployment target is set to iOS 16.0 or higher (required for NavigationStack and modern SwiftUI syntax).

Build and run on a Simulator or a physical device.
